This directory contains classes for accessing a chado database.  Classes are organized on a per 
module basis.  This means for each module, there will be a class that contains methods related to
a chado module.  For example, the publication module contains pub_dbxref, pub, pubprop and pubauthors. 
In this case, the publication class would provide all the methods necessary for interfacing with 
these tables.  This design choice was made becuase most of the time, independently these tables
do not have much meaning and must be joined to obtain anything useful.

README File for biophp

What is this?

BioPHP is yet another rendition of BioPHP that aims to build on some of the other
BioPHP implementations and focus more on data management.

Why is it needed?

Perl, Java, and Python maintain a very active community with regards to bioinformatics.  This
is an attempt to provide a bioinformatics component for PHP.  Our shop currently utilizes
a content management framework called Drupal for model organism databases.  While Drupal provides
a very flexible framework, there is not a good API for bioinformatics.  So as I develop code, I plan
on enhancing this library.



This software library is very new and I am actively developing it.  For now, you may
find a few useful things that you can use.  

The plan is as follows:

1.  Add chado database interfaces
    a.  Object oriented database interface that can be extended for your own needs.
    b.  Based on PHP PDO for maximum flexibility.
    c.  Can be used as a database library to quickly build php based applications for chado
2.  Add sequence manipulation and import functionality for chado
    a.  Add sequence manipulation and utility functions.
    b.  Add ability to work with different file formats.
3.  Add Analysis tools and data management for analysis tools, like BLAST and FASTA.
